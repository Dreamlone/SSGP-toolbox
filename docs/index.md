Welcome to [SSGP-toolbox](https://github.com/Dreamlone/SSGP-toolbox) tool documentation!

Wiredflow is an open-source lightweight Python library for configuring ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. 
Designed to create services with multi-step data processing using just Python and nothing more.

The main body of documentation is organized into two large sections: 

- **Common description** - provides general information about how the library works, what its advantages and limitations are. 
  Also in this section you can find detailed information about the interior of the library;
- **Tutorials** - is a step-by-step guide showing from the very beginning how to work
  with wiredflow and construct own multi-threading or multi-processes services

Tip: 
> If you know what is APIs, 
> databases, SQL, ETL, docker (and so on) and would like to get some description of wiredflow - feel free to check **Common description**, 
> if you don't know what's going on here or just want to start use this tool, go to **Tutorials**. There you will find both usage examples,
> and a detailed explanation of the technologies that are used

There is also an **"Additional"** section with different useful pages. 
For example, in the **"Additional"** section you can find information about publications 
using wiredflow as well as descriptions of real commercial use cases.

In this section there is a page describing how to contribute into library - it is important 

> Guys, this is open-source, join in!
