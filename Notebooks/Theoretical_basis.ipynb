A gap of a certain size and shape was generated for each of the 6 images. A total of 8 types of gaps were generated. The results of these tests can be seen below. In most cases, the algorithm was wrong by less than 1 Celsius degree, despite the fact that the average temperature spread in the gap was about 10 degrees. You can see the results of algorithm verification below.\n",
